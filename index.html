                    <p>Autonomous systems can have radically different definitions depending on the user. For the sake of this presentation, we will be using the following definition provided by TechTarget: <blockquote>The technology-enabled automation of activities or services that accomplish a specific function or workflow. </blockquote>This is a blanket definition that covers the majority of industries and processes reviewed in this article. In most cases, a business process is initiated by a trigger such as a customer placing a merchandise order. The goal of autonomous systems is to automate the workflow that follows the trigger. By systemizing these steps, the business can improve its efficiency and reduce costs on a very large scale. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">History</h2>

                    <p>Business System Automation and technology have always had a strong correlation. After all, the driving force of technology has always been to improve business efficiency. Perhaps one of the most notable business leaders of the past, Henry Ford, systemized the automobile industry with the production line. While this workflow was developed without modern technology and is far from fully autonomous, at the roots it embraces the autonomous system mindset</p>
                
                <p>In todayâ€™s workplace, we are seeing more and more of the mundane processes become automated allowing for employees to shift their focus to projects requiring a human mind. As it stands, tasks such as creative thinking or decision making are usually left to actual employees rather than systems. However, as technology continues to evolve we will most likely be seeing more decisions being made programmatically. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Future</h2>

                    <p>It is certainly hard to predict the future, especially with regards to technology. We are beginning to see glimpses of what might be coming. The market is becoming flooded with products with varying degrees of automation. Things like self-driving cars and drone delivery seem more feasible everyday. Will robots soon perform cleaning tasks? Microchips monitoring our health? It is impossible to tell which of these technologies will blossom, but the one sure bet is that more and more of business processes are becoming automated. With this automation employees and funds will be freed to focus on more unique and untapped business projects.   </p>
